# AIDassist
AIDassist, our mission is to reduce food waste and fight hunger by creating an efficient network that connects surplus food with people in need.  We envision a world where no edible food goes to waste while people go hungry. Through technology and community engagement, we're building sustainable solutions to address food insecurity.
